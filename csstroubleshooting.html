<!--The issue in the provided CSS code is that the container has a percentage-based width, but the parent element (body) doesn't have a specified height. 
    This can lead to unexpected results in centering. To fix this, you can set the height of the body to 100%, and also ensure that the HTML and body elements have a height of 100%. 
    Additionally, set the display property of the container to flex and use align-items and justify-content to center it.-->
